			<h2>Overview</h2>
			In this project we impleted rasterizing of triangles, supersampling, transformations, barycentric coordinates, pixel sampling for texture mapping, and level sampling with mipmaps for texture mapping. The end result allows us to take images and perform all our implementations on them, for example we had a picture of a few triangles which we rasterized and were blurry, but after implementing supersampling at sampling at a higher rate, the jaggies faded off. There was a image of a robot that we used our transforms implementations on to change the orientations, location, and scale of its body. After we implemented barycentric coordinates, we used them for texture sampling to get nice images of things like a world map, a parrot, and the Campanile.

			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			Rasterizing triangles in the simple case took three line tests. With three points as inputs to represent the vertices of a triangle, we can define a bounding box from the top-most, left-most to bottom-most, right-most point. We also define the edges of the triangle as the pairwise coordinates of two adjacent vertices. We can then iterate through every sample midpoint (x, y) + (0.5, 0.5) and perform cross-product line direction tests to see if the point is always on the left of the three given triangle lines (or always on the right, for clockwise-oriented triangles). If true, then we know the sample point is within the edges of the triangle, and can be rasterized via coloration of the pixel.

			This approach thus only calculates the "inside-ness" of pixels within the bounding box that contains the triangle, rather than the entire frame. From the top left to bottom right, two for loops iterate every sample point starting at the top line, where it should contain the top vertex or edge of the triangle, then iterate the next row of pixels until it reaches the bottom edge or vertex. The for loops do not account for pixels beyond since we define our start and end conditions to be those maximum boundaries.

			<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
			In order to implement super sampling up to a sample rate of 16, we took advantage of a sample buffer. By scaling the sample buffer, we can take an input triangle, and effectively sample sub-pixels inside of each real pixel location. Unlike the basic case where we would sample the exact center of each pixel in a 1:1 ratio between the sample buffer and the frame buffer, we introduce two new parameters, dx and dy. Thus, we can test sub-pixel locations in a grid of sqrt(sample rate) x sqrt(sample rate). Take a sample rate of 16 for example, we could add dx and dy increments on top of each (x, y) pixel to test a 4 x 4 grid of sub pixels, and mark their locations in our sample buffer. In this case, our sample buffer would be 16 times as long, so that we could store 16 sub pixels for every 1 input pixel. After sampling all sub pixels, we resolve the sample buffer into our frame buffer by iterating through all the 16 pixel groupings, and downsample all of the sub pixels into a single pixel location via averaging. This effectively smoothes out locations with high frequency changes by spreading out that change in color over more pixels.

			<br>

			This task's largest challenge was understanding how scaling our sample buffer would make it possible to average our colors in each pixel. We started by attempting to average each coordinates' sub pixels before moving on, however this caused strange artefacts in cases where triangles were bordering. While individual triangles surrounded by background were anti-aliased fine, there were some collision issues were bordering triangles inside a pixel could not "communicate" that they were going to partially color a fraction of the pixel one color. This meant entire sections of pixels were left uncolored when new triangles overwrote the work of previous triangles. In order to super sample effectively, we had to collect all colors in the sample buffer first, where we could then work our way down.

			<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>

			<figcaption>Our Robot Waving :).</figcaption>

			For this task, we used the transformations that we implemented to make our robot's head rotate and scale to the right size, in addition we applied a rotation to the right arm to try to make it look like the robot is waving!



			<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
			Barycentric coordinates are a way to select a point on a RGB triangle, the point is unique in the sense that its location on the triangle has a unique rgb value, each point in the triangle has a unique rgb value that can be represented with barycentric coordinates using alpha, beta and gamma, for example in the triangle below, if a point had a coordinate of alpha = 1, beta = 0, and gamma = 0, the sampled point could be an all red point since barycentric coordinates let us sample for a color or texture. Another example is that if we had alpha, beta, gamma = (0.5,0.5,0), we might sample purple at these barycentric coordinates since the value of alpha, beta, gamma can be thought of as how close we are to the corresponding vertice.

			<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
			Task 5 picks up from Task 2's super-sampling code as a foundation, but incoporates the use of barycentric coordinates for fetching colors from a texture map. At each sub pixel, we use barycentric coordinates to determine how changes in the screen space (x,y) map to changes in the texture space (u,v) via our alpha, beta, and gamma proportions. After passing these values into our texture pixel (texel) sampler's parameters, we scale the (u,v) coordinates to the size of our texture map to select the return color. The rasterizer can either employ sampling via the nearest texel in the texture map (sample_nearest), or employ bilinear sampling that clamps the nearest upper left texel (since we define origin as the top left) and retuns the linearly interpolating the average color of it and its 3 corner texels based on proximity.

			<br>

			Linearly interpolating the texels can be important when your texture has high degrees of distortion, or high frequency changes, since the blending of the 4 nearby texels can reduce the amount of artefacts produced by sharp or jagged changes in color and shape!

			<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
			Task 6 takes what we learned from Task 5, and introduces level sampling alongside our pixel sampling parameters. The defaut "Level Zero" approach always renders using the full resolution texture map of mipmap level 0. However, when we want to precompute lower resolution texture maps, we initiate the get_level function which computes a mipmap level based on the relative sizing, in order of how many times the resolution has been halved. Therefore, when "Level Nearest" is selected where we round off the level computed by the get_level function and sample from that mipmap level. Otherwise, trilinear filtering takes it a step further, and takes the two adjacent mipmap levels from the level returned by get_level, the nearest above and below levels, and interpolates the two together to choose the color to return.

			<br>

			Level 0 sampling is the fastest as it takes no extra computing, and also uses the least memory since it only uses the level 0 mipmap. However, it has the highest aliasing due to direct texel selection even if there are distorted pixels. Nearest level sampling is slightly slower than the previous due to the mipmap level calculations based on the uv offsets, and also has some extra memory usage to generate the mipmaps, but with some anti-aliasing for triangles that are smaller and make be distorted. Beyond that, trilinear filtering is the slowest due to the calculations of two adjacent mipmap levels, but doesn't require extra memory than what is already calculated by nearest level, and has the best anti-aliasing as it also blends the textures between two mipmap levels where there may be sharp warps.'
