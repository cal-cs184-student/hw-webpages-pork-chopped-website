			<h2>Overview</h2>
			In this homework, we implemented a real-time simulation of cloth. To get started, we first had to create the actual cloth which we did by having point masses and springs that connect them. We had 3 different kinds of springs that allowed the cloth to move realistically. Next, we implemented simulation of movement that took into account both external forces like gravity and spring correction forces, by calculating the force acting on each point mass and applying these forces using Verlet Integration with a damping factor to account for energy loss, we were able to realistically simulate the cloth falling and moving around. Next we had to handle the cloth colliding with other objects, by pushing point masses out of spheres and planes, we were able to implement realistic collision where our cloth could wrap around a sphere or fall flat onto a plane, this part took into account friction and the spring constant KS. We also handle self collisions by organizing our point masses into 3D boxes, if two points in any box are too close together, we pushed them away, this allowed our cloth to fall and fold onto itself rather than be a stiff board. In the final part we learned and implemented some shaders using openGL, some of the different types of shading and lighting we implemented were diffuse, Blinn Phong, texture, displacement, bump, and mirror. I think something interesting we learned while doing this homework was how much some of the parameters that we could adjust like the density, spring constant, and damping could affect our cloth simulation.

			<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
			<p>For Part 2, we incorporate two forces for simulation. The first, external forces (e.g. gravity), and the second, spring correction forces.</p>
			<p>We first begin by calculating force acting on each point mass. For external forces acting on each point mass, we follow \(F = ma\). Then, for every spring, we calculate spring correction forces with \(F_s = k_s \cdot ( \| p_a - p_b \| - l )\), where \(k_s\) is the spring constant, \(p_a\) & \(p_a\) are the end positions of our spring, and \(l\) is the length of the spring.</p>
			<p>For every point mass that is not pinned, we apply the forces to each using Verlet Integration with a damping factor to account for energy loss from friction, heat, etc.:</p>

			<p>\[x_{t+\Delta t}=x_t+(1-d)\cdot\bigl(x_t-x_{t-\Delta t}\bigr)+a_t\cdot\Delta t^2\]</p>

			<ul>
				<li>\(x_t\): position</li>
				<li>\(d\): damping term [0,1] to simulate energy loss.</li>
				<li>\(a_t\): current acceleration from all forces</li>
				<li>\(\Delta t\): time step (delta_t)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Then to limit the spring deformation and stretch to reasonable amounts, where any pair of unpinned point masses are constrained and corrected towards at most 10% greater than the spring rest length.</p>

			<p>Adjusting the properties of the fabric results in a few notable differences. Lower spring constants resulted in the fabric stretching more, as it drapes lower and swings with more pronounced waves. The higher spring constants appear more rigid in rest and in motion. The low density fabric folds over relaxed with one larger crease at the top compared to the high density fabric, which experienced bowing on the sides due to higher tension as well as tighter upper folds. With no dampening, the fabric's motion was chaotic, as it conserved all the energy converted from potential to kinetic with volatile ripples and great swings. The fabric with 100% dampening fell down rather elegantly, although slower than would be expected with Earth's gravity, there was little to no over-swing, as it reached a near rest position by the first one. The final example of fabric simulation with all four corners pinned sits comfortably, as each corner's tension causes diagonal peaks, with smooth valleys resting between each.</p>
			<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
			In our implementation of handling collisions with spheres, we see if the point mass is inside the sphere by subtracting the origin of the sphere from the position of the point mass to get a vector, if the norm of this vector is smaller than the radius of the sphere, then we know the point mass is inside the sphere, to push it out to the surface of the sphere, we divide our vector by its norm to get a unit vector pointing in the direction of the point mass from origin of the sphere, we then do the origin of the sphere plus the unit vector being multiplied by the spheres radius and set this as the new position of the point mass since this new position is where the point mass would intersect the sphere, we then scale this position by 1-friction. If we found that the norm of the distance vector was larger than the radius of the sphere, we know that the point mass is outside the sphere so we skip it. We do this collision check for all point masses.

			For our implementation of handling collisions with planes, we take advantage of the fact that all point masses have a last_position and position vector to represent their coordinates, we get two vectors, one from the last position to the point on the plane, and another from the current position to the point on the plane. We take the dot products of the current position vector, if it is negative then we know the point mass moved to a different side of the plane. We then calculate t which is the distance from the old point to the plane, we use this t to find the tangent point which is the old position + t * the distance from the current position to the last position. We then calculate a correction vector which is the tangent point + the plane normal times the sufrace offset minus the last position. Then we apply this correction vector to the last position and scale this position by 1-friction.

			<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
			<p>Now that our cloth can handle simple collisions with planes and spheres, we arive at the question of how we simulate the cloth at a realistic resting state? To achieve this, we added self-collision functionality during simulation.</p>

			<p>Firstly, we organize our point masses into 3D boxes, based on the point mass's position. The boxes have dimensions \( w \cdot h \cdot t \) determined via 3 equations: \( w = 3 \cdot width / numwidthpoints \), \( h = 3 \cdot height / numheightpoints \), and \( t = max(w,h) \). Based on these number of points, the size of these adjacency boxes of point masses scale.</p>

			<p>Secondly, we iterate through all of the point masses inside our fabric to initialize a map that assigns each point mass to the unique identifier of its corresponding box.</p>

			<p>Thirdly, for every point mass, we check every other point mass within the shared adjacency box, and check if the two are within \( 2 \cdot thickness \) distance apart. If so, we start collecting up correctional forces from all the other point masses, then average them out to apply to the original input point mass to simulate the fabric pushing against itself (perfectly folded fabric could only be \(2 \cdot thickness \) wide).</p>

			<p>From a qualitative standpoint, it is no question that all of the above settings for the fabric begin at the same state. However, during simulation of self-collision, there are some noticable differences in the way the fabric interacts with itself. The default fabric has medium folds, with ripples traveling partially up the fabric as it is pulled downwards by gravity. The increased density fabric folds into smaller creases, and has less ripple effects presumably due to the increased force required to move the fabric. Comparing the low spring vs high spring constant cases, the higher the spring constant (more rigid), the larger the folds as the springs resist creasing with high tension.</p>

			<p>By the time the fabrics are all laid out on the plane, the influences of the fabric parameters still have some nuance. The default fabric lays somewhat comfortably with some ripples. The high density fabric on the other hand has tighter folds, with ripples left over from the random unwavering drop. Finally, the more rigid fabric with tighter spring forces is pulled into a smoother texture with no ripples, whereas lower spring forces left the fabric in a contorted rest position.</p>

			<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
			<p>In OpenGL, we apply two kinds of shaders: vertex and fragment shaders. The vertex shader takes in a model's vertices and does the job of transforming the inputted positions in model space into world space via matrix transformations (with displacements when desired). The vertex shader also helps out the fragment shader by defining the normals, texture map coordinates, tangents, and screen position. The fragment shader takes outputs from the vertex shader to further apply lighting and material textures to the model. These inputs are then used to compute lighting effects caused by ambient, diffuse, specular, texture, bump, and displacement sources.</p>

			<p>Speaking of Blinn-Phong, BP shading combines ambient lighting around the world with the diffuse and specular light from an illuminated source. We selected a decent uniform ambient lighting of 0.1, which would lightly brighten the colors in the scene without removing too much contrast. Diffuse lighting was implemented by taking the inputted uniform color, then scaling down the brightness from our light source by distance and the angle the light impacted the surface. The specular lighting was calculated similarly, except scaled by distance and the relative position of the camera to the normal (which was further modified by raising the factor to the power of 12, giving off a bright but not too sharp reflective shine). </p>

			</div>

			<p> For bump mapping and displacement mapping, we built upon the Blinn Phong shading model by adding some depth to the fabric and sphere. Bump mapping fakes surface detail by adjusting normals in the fragment shader based on a height map. We calculate partial derivatives like <code>dU = (h(u + 1/w, v) - h(u, v)) * k_h * k_n</code> and create a new normal <code>no = vec3(-dU, -dV, 1.0)</code>, which we transform into model space using the TBN matrix. This makes lighting react as if the surface is bumpy without modifying the mesh itself.</p>
			<p> Displacement mapping actually shifts the vertex positions in the vertex shader. We use a formula like <code>p' = p + n * h(u, v) * k_h</code> to move each vertex along its normal based on the height map. This changes both lighting and silhouette, so it's more realistic than just adding fake lighting to the otherwise smooth surfaces.</p>

			<p>Adjusting the coarseness of the mesh, from 16 to 128, effectively changes the range of spikiness in the mesh. The lower coarseness sphere has fewer spikes, with a more distributed appearance of jagged points and a round-ish surface. The high coarseness sphere mesh has many more points, leading to a wide variety of sheer depth changes between the many points. Also check out the mirror skin!</p>
