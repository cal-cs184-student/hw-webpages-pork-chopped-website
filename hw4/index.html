		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
			<p>For Part 2, we incorporate two forces for simulation. The first, external forces (e.g. gravity), and the second, spring correction forces.</p>
			<p>We first begin by calculating force acting on each point mass. For external forces acting on each point mass, we follow \(F = ma\). Then, for every spring, we calculate spring correction forces with \(F_s = k_s \cdot ( \| p_a - p_b \| - l )\), where \(k_s\) is the spring constant, \(p_a\) & \(p_a\) are the end positions of our spring, and \(l\) is the length of the spring.</p>
			<p>For every point mass that is not pinned, we apply the forces to each using Verlet Integration with a damping factor to account for energy loss from friction, heat, etc.:</p>

			<p>\[x_{t+\Delta t}=x_t+(1-d)\cdot\bigl(x_t-x_{t-\Delta t}\bigr)+a_t\cdot\Delta t^2\]</p>

			<ul>
				<li>\(x_t\): position</li>
				<li>\(d\): damping term [0,1] to simulate energy loss.</li>
				<li>\(a_t\): current acceleration from all forces</li>
				<li>\(\Delta t\): time step (delta_t)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Then to limit the spring deformation and stretch to reasonable amounts, where any pair of unpinned point masses are constrained and corrected towards at most 10% greater than the spring rest length.</p>

				<p>Adjusting the properties of the fabric results in a few notable differences. Lower spring constants resulted in the fabric stretching more, as it drapes lower and swings with more pronounced waves. The higher spring constants appear more rigid in rest and in motion. The low density fabric folds over relaxed with one larger crease at the top compared to the high density fabric, which experienced bowing on the sides due to higher tension as well as tighter upper folds. With no dampening, the fabric's motion was chaotic, as it conserved all the energy converted from potential to kinetic with volatile ripples and great swings. The fabric with 100% dampening fell down rather elegantly, although slower than would be expected with Earth's gravity, there was little to no over-swing, as it reached a near rest position by the first one. The final example of fabric simulation with all four corners pinned sits comfortably, as each corner's tension causes diagonal peaks, with smooth valleys resting between each.</p>
		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		In our implementation of handling collisions with spheres, we see if the point mass is inside the sphere by subtracting the origin of the sphere from the position of the point mass to get a vector, if the norm of this vector is smaller than the radius of the sphere, then we know the point mass is inside the sphere, to push it out to the surface of the sphere, we divide our vector by its norm to get a unit vector pointing in the direction of the point mass from origin of the sphere, we then do the origin of the sphere plus the unit vector being multiplied by the spheres radius and set this as the new position of the point mass since this new position is where the point mass would intersect the sphere, we then scale this position by 1-friction. If we found that the norm of the distance vector was larger than the radius of the sphere, we know that the point mass is outside the sphere so we skip it. We do this collision check for all point masses.

		For our implementation of handling collisions with planes, we take advantage of the fact that all point masses have a last_position and position vector to represent their coordinates, we get two vectors, one from the last position to the point on the plane, and another from the current position to the point on the plane. We take the dot products of the current position vector, if it is negative then we know the point mass moved to a different side of the plane. We then calculate t which is the distance from the old point to the plane, we use this t to find the tangent point which is the old position + t * the distance from the current position to the last position. We then calculate a correction vector which is the tangent point + the plane normal times the sufrace offset minus the last position. Then we apply this correction vector to the last position and scale this position by 1-friction.
